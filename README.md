# Robust Sparse Mean Estimation

This project implement the subgradient method for robust mean estimation and compare it with other algorithms under the heavy-tailed setting. We make use of some of the code in the following papers for our experiments: "Outlier-Robust High-Dimensional Sparse Estimation via Iterative Filtering" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08085), "Outlier-Robust Sparse Estimation via Non-Convex Optimization" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.11515) and Robust Learning of Fixed-Structure Bayesian Networks in Nearly-Linear Time (https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.05555).
